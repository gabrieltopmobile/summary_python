It’s that simple!\n\n•\tSwipe With Friends—It’s all about going out with friends and meeting new people. Invite your friends to go out, then swipe and match with other groups who want to meet up. Start the party with group chat, make plans and get out tonight! \n\n•\tWhen you see an individual or group you really want to connect with, tap the blue star or Swipe Up to send a Super Like.\n\n•\tUpgrade to Tinder Plus for premium features, including: Passport to connect with people anywhere around the world, Rewind to give someone a second chance, one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes, and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\n•\tUpgrade to Tinder Gold for our most exclusive features: Passport, Rewind, Unlimited Likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls—as well as our new Likes You feature, so that you can see who likes you before you swipe.
